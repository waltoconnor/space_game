This is the server for a simplistic clone of EVE Online that I've been writing using Bevy.
Currently the game has a galaxy composed of solar systems linked by warp gates. Each solar system has a set of planets, moons, asteroid belts, and stations.
Players can control their ship's motion manually, or by entering commands to the flight computer.
There is a working inventory and market system, based on a "Buy Order/Sell Order" model.
I developed a client for this server in Godot, and I will upload it once I strip out the copywritten assets I am using as placeholders.
